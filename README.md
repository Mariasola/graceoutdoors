# Grace Outdoors CSS experiment
This is a CSS experiment to overlap png illustrations and adapt the exact same landscape in all devices. 

## To make it work you will need to:
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com), then dowload the repository and:
1. Install the local dependencies with `$ npm install`
2. See the result in your browser with `$ gulp`

## Wait...Do I have to do this every time?
> ### Just the first time you use it in a new computer:
- You will need to install node
- And install Gulp globally so you can use it in any other folder with `npm install --global gulp-cli`


## Project structure


La estructura de carpetas tiene esta pinta:
```
/
`- _src
   |- assets
   |  |- icons
   |  |- images
   |  |- js
   |  `- scss
   |     `- core
   |
   `- templates
      `- partials
         |- _header
         |- _link
         |- _main
      index.html


```
